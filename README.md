# Deploying a Pretrained Sentiment Analysis Model with FastAPI

This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy a pretrained Hugging Face sentiment analysis model using FastAPI. It is intended for developers, machine learning (ML) engineers, and data scientists seeking to expose ML models through a RESTful API using Python-based tools.

This guide follows best practices in documentation as outlined in the [Google Developer Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style), prioritizing clarity, precision, and reader-first communication.

## Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will learn how to:

- Load a pretrained model using Hugging Face Transformers.
- Serve model predictions through an HTTP endpoint using FastAPI.
- Test the endpoint using `curl`, Postman, or Swagger UI.
- Understand the structure of a production-friendly ML API deployment.
